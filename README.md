# Necrobarder
Work in progress port of the bard section of Crypt of the Necrodancer to the Nintendo GBA. God help me.

Can be built by downloading devkitpro with the ARM and GBA components, placing libGBA in the top-level directory (next to include and source), and compiling. 

The resulting .gba file is tested to run on VBA 1.8.0
